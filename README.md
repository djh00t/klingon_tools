## klingon_tools

`klingon_tools` is a Python package that provides a set of utilities designed to automate and simplify various tasks, making them more efficient and less error-prone. This package includes tools for logging, git operations, OpenAI integration, and more.

### Features

- **Logging Tools**: Provides decorators for methods and CLI commands to log output in a clean and consistent manner with simple error handling.
- **Git Tools**: Functions to interact with a Git repository, including staging, committing, pushing changes, and running pre-commit hooks.
- **OpenAI Tools**: Tools for generating commit messages, pull request titles, and release bodies using OpenAI's API.
- **GitHub Actions Update**: Utility to check and update GitHub Actions versions in workflows.

### Installation

To install `klingon_tools`, use pip:

```sh
pip install klingon_tools
```

### Usage

#### Logging Tools

The `logtools` module provides utilities for running and logging shell commands in a user-friendly manner. It includes the `LogTools` class, which offers decorators for methods and CLI commands to log output in a clean and consistent manner with simple error handling.

**Example Usage of `logtools`**

```python
from klingon_tools import LogTools

log_tools = LogTools(debug=True)

@log_tools.method_state(name="Install numpy")
def install_numpy():
    return "PIP_ROOT_USER_ACTION=ignore pip install -q numpy"

install_numpy()
```

**Expected output:**

```plaintext
Running Install numpy...                                               OK
```

#### Git Tools

The `git_tools` module provides functions to interact with a Git repository, including staging, committing, pushing changes, and running pre-commit hooks. It also includes functions to retrieve the status of the repository and handle deleted files.

**Example Usage of `git_tools`**

```python
from klingon_tools.git_tools import git_get_toplevel, git_commit_file

repo = git_get_toplevel()
if repo:
    git_commit_file('example.txt', repo)
```

#### OpenAI Tools

The `openai_tools` module provides tools for generating commit messages, pull request titles, and release bodies using OpenAI's API.

**Example Usage of `openai_tools`**

```python
from klingon_tools.openai_tools import OpenAITools

openai_tools = OpenAITools()
diff = "diff content here"
commit_message = openai_tools.generate_commit_message(diff)
print(commit_message)
```

#### GitHub Actions Update

The `gh_actions_update` module provides functionality to check and update GitHub Actions versions in YAML workflow files within a repository.

**Example Usage of `gh-actions-update`**

```sh
python -m klingon_tools.gh_actions_update
```

To update all outdated actions to the latest version, use the `--update` flag:

```sh
python -m klingon_tools.gh_actions_update --update
```

### Entry Points

The package provides several entry points for command-line usage:

- `push`: Automates git operations such as staging, committing, and pushing files.
- `gh-actions-update`: Checks and updates GitHub Actions versions in workflows.
- `pr-title-generate`: Generates a pull request title using OpenAI's API.
- `pr-summary-generate`: Generates a pull request summary using OpenAI's API.
- `pr-context-generate`: Generates a pull request context using OpenAI's API.
- `pr-body-generate`: Generates a pull request body using OpenAI's API.

### Example Usage of `push`

The `push` entry point automates git operations such as staging, committing,
and pushing files. It also integrates with pre-commit hooks and generates
conventional commit messages using OpenAI's API.

**Usage**

An entrypoint for `push` is installed when klingon_tools is installed so `push`
can be run from the command line without specifying the module.

If your environment does not support entrypoints, you can run the following
command:

```sh
python -m klingon_tools.push --repo-path /path/to/repo --file-name example.txt
```

### Example Usage of `gh-actions-update`

The `gh-actions-update` entry point finds all GitHub Actions in the current repository, checks the version they are using, and retrieves the most recent version of each action. It returns a table containing "Action Name", "Current Version", and "Latest Version" columns.

**Usage**

```sh
python -m klingon_tools.gh_actions_update
```

To update all outdated actions to the latest version, use the `--update` flag:

```sh
python -m klingon_tools.gh_actions_update --update
```

To update actions in a specific file (bash wildcards accepted), use the `--file` flag:

```sh
python -m klingon_tools.gh_actions_update --update --file {filename}
```

To update all instances of a specific action, use the `--action` flag:

```sh
python -m klingon_tools.gh_actions_update --update --action {action name}
```

To update all instances of a specific action in a specific file, use both `--file` and `--action` flags:

```sh
python -m klingon_tools.gh_actions_update --update --file {filename} --action {action name}
```

### Example Output

```plaintext
Action Name          Current Version    Latest Version
-------------------  -----------------  ---------------
actions/checkout     v2                 v3
actions/setup-python v1                 v2

Note: Use '--update' to update all outdated actions to the latest version.
Use '--update --file {filename}' to update a specific file (bash wildcards accepted).
Use '--action {action name}' to update all instances of a specific action.
Use '--action' and '--file' together to update all instances of a specific action in a specific file.
```

### Semver Versioning

Versioning uses the semver standard. The version is stored in pyproject.toml
under the [poetry.tools] section.

## Usage

Each utility has its own specific usage instructions, which can be found in the comments of the utility's script. In general, utilities can be run from the command line and accept various command-line arguments.

### Example Usage of `gh-actions-update`

The `gh-actions-update` entrypoint finds all GitHub Actions in the current repository, checks the version they are using, and retrieves the most recent version of each action. It returns a table containing "Action Name", "Current Version", and "Latest Version" columns.

#### Usage

To use the `gh-actions-update` entrypoint, run the following command:

```sh
python -m klingon_tools.gh_actions_update
```

To update all outdated actions to the latest version, use the `--update` flag:

```sh
python -m klingon_tools.gh_actions_update --update
```

To update actions in a specific file (bash wildcards accepted), use the `--file` flag:

### Example Usage of `makefile_logger`

The `makefile_logger.py` script allows you to log messages from a Makefile using the same logging style as `klingon_tools`. This ensures consistent logging across your project.

#### Usage

To use the `makefile_logger.py` script, call it from your Makefile with the desired log level and message. The available log levels are `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, and `DEBUG`.

**Example Makefile Usage:**

```makefile
# Log an informational message
@python klingon_tools/makefile_logger.py INFO "Cleaning up repo"

# Log a warning message
@python klingon_tools/makefile_logger.py WARNING "This is a warning"

# Log an error message
@python klingon_tools/makefile_logger.py ERROR "An error occurred"

# Log a debug message
@python klingon_tools/makefile_logger.py DEBUG "Debugging information"
```

This will log messages with the appropriate status icons, ensuring that your Makefile logs are consistent with the rest of your project's logging.

The `logtools` utility provides decorators for methods and CLI commands that log output in a clean and consistent manner with simple error handling.

#### Method State Example

```python
from klingon_tools import LogTools

log_tools = LogTools(debug=True)

@log_tools.method_state(name="Install numpy")
def install_numpy():
    return "PIP_ROOT_USER_ACTION=ignore pip install -q numpy"

install_numpy()
```

Expected output:

```plaintext
Running Install numpy...                                               OK
```

#### Command State Example

```python
from klingon_tools import LogTools

commands = [
    ("PIP_ROOT_USER_ACTION=ignore pip install -q numpy", "Install numpy"),
    ("echo 'Hello, World!'", "Print Hello World")
]
log_tools.command_state(commands)
```

Expected output:

```plaintext
Running Install numpy...                                               OK
```
