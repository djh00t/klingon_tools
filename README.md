# Utility Repository

This repository contains a set of utilities that are frequently used. These utilities are designed to automate and simplify various tasks, making them more efficient and less error-prone.

## Contents

Currently, the repository includes the following utilities:

- `treetool (tt)`: A tool for mapping and generating directory structures. 
- `gitignore`: A file containing patterns of files to be ignored by git. See [gitignore/README.md](gitignore/README.md) for more details.

    tt was designed to provide a rapid way of generating directory and file
    structures for new projects. It can take a CSV file as input to create a
    directory structure or generate a CSV file representing the file and
    directory structure from an existing directory. It also has a raw
    mode that accepts raw input from `tree -F` and generates a CSV file from it.

## Usage

Each utility has its own specific usage instructions, which can be found in the comments of the utility's script. In general, utilities can be run from the command line and accept various command-line arguments.

## Installation

Some utilities may require installation. For example, `treetool/tt` can be installed into `/usr/local/bin/` using the `-i` or `--install` command-line argument.
