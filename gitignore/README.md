# gitignore

This file contains a list of file patterns that git will ignore. These are typically files that are generated by the system or the build process, and do not need to be checked into version control.

The patterns in this file are organized by the type of file or system that generates them. For example, there are sections for files generated by macOS, Windows, and various programming languages and tools.

For more information on how to use this file, see the [gitignore documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore).
