### High-Level Design for GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline

#### 1. Repository Structure
- **Root Directory**
  - `.github/`
    - `workflows/`
      - `ci.yml` (Continuous Integration workflow)
      - `cd.yml` (Continuous Deployment workflow)
  - `src/` (Source code)
  - `tests/` (Unit tests)
  - `docs/` (Documentation)
  - `CHANGELOG.md` (Changelog)
  - `README.md` (Project overview)
  - `TEMPLATE-USAGE.md` (Template usage instructions)
  - `requirements.in` (Input requirements file for pip-tools)
  - `requirements.txt` (Compiled requirements file)
  - `setup.py` (Setup tools configuration)
  - `setup.cfg` (Setup tools configuration)
  - `tox.ini` (Tox configuration)
  - `.gitignore` (Git ignore file)
  - `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (Pre-commit hooks configuration)

#### 2. Versioning and Conventional Commits
- **Commit Message Linting**
  - Use `commitlint` to enforce conventional commit syntax.
  - Use push/push from `https://github.com/djh00t/klingon_tools` to generate conventional commit messages on push.
- **Automated Versioning**
  - Use `semantic-release` to handle automatic versioning based on conventional commit messages.
- **AI-Based Versioning**
  - Integrate OpenAI API to analyze PRs and decide which part of the semver version to increment.

#### 3. Branch Protection and Workflow
- **Branch Protection**
  - Protect the main branch to ensure only tested and peer-reviewed code is merged.
  - Require PR approval from at least one reviewer.
- **Workflow for Pull Requests**
  - Trigger CI pipeline on pull request creation and updates.
  - Run linting, unit tests, and code style checks.

#### 4. Code Quality and Testing
- **Code Style and Linting**
  - Use `pylint` and `yapf` to enforce Google code style guides.
- **Unit Testing**
  - Use `pytest` for unit tests.
  - Use `tox` to test on multiple versions of Python.
- **Testing Workflow**
  - Run all tests on each push to a development branch.
  - Prevent changes with failing tests from being approved for release.

#### 5. AI Integration
- **PR Titles and Bodies**
  - Use OpenAI API to generate titles and bodies for PRs.
- **Release Notes and Changelogs**
  - Use OpenAI API to generate high-quality release notes and changelogs.
- **AI-Based Peer Reviews**
  - Use OpenAI API to generate AI-based peer review comments on PRs.

#### 6. Release Management
- **Draft Release**
  - Generate a draft release and push it to PyPI Test.
  - Notify repo owner for approval.
- **Final Release**
  - Once approved, build and push the release to PyPI Production.

#### 7. Dependency Management
- **Pip Tools**
  - Use `pip-tools` to manage dependencies.
  - Maintain `requirements.in` and use `pip-compile` to generate `requirements.txt`.

#### 8. Configuration and Setup
- **Setup Tools**
  - Use `setup.py` and `setup.cfg` for project configuration.
- **Automation Script**
  - Provide a script or Makefile to update the template repository, adding or patching features and triggering a PR for approval.

#### 9. Pre-Commit Hooks
- **Base Configuration**
  - Include a base `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file for pre-commit hooks.
  - Ensure the configuration is auto-managed and updated via a method such as `make update`.
- **Project-Specific Configuration**
  - Allow including/excluding project-specific configurations within the `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.

### CI/CD Workflow Configuration

#### CI Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
```yaml

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:

```

#### CD Workflow (`.github/workflows/cd.yml`)
```yaml
name: CD

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  draft_release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

          twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*
          # Uncomment for production
          # twine upload dist/*
```

### Additional Scripts

#### AI Review Script (`scripts/ai_review.py`)
```python
import openai
import os

# Authenticate with OpenAI API
openai.api_key = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')

# Get the list of changed files and the diff
changed_files = os.popen('git diff --name-only HEAD^').read().splitlines()
diff = os.popen('git diff HEAD^').read()

# Generate AI-based review comments
response = openai.Completion.create(
  engine="davinci-codex",
  prompt=f"Review the following code changes:\n\n{diff}\n\nProvide review comments:",
  max_tokens=500
)

comments = response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Output comments to the console or post them to the PR
print(comments)
```

#### Generate Draft Release Script (`scripts/generate_draft_release.py`)
```python
import openai
import os

# Authenticate with OpenAI API
openai.api_key = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')

# Collect changelog data
changelog = os.popen('git log --pretty=format:"%s" $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)..HEAD').read()

# Generate release notes
response = openai.Completion.create(
  engine="davinci-codex",
  prompt=f"Generate release notes from the following changelog:\n\n{changelog}",
  max_tokens=500
)

release_notes = response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Save release notes to CHANGELOG.md
with open('CHANGELOG.md', 'a') as f:
    f.write(f"\n## New Release\n\n{release_notes}")

# Draft the release (example with GitHub CLI)
os.system(f'gh release create draft --notes "{release_notes}" --target main')
```

### Pre-Commit Configuration

#### Base `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v3.4.0
    hooks:
      - id: trailing-whitespace
      - id: end-of-file-fixer
      - id: check-yaml
  - repo: https://github.com/pycqa/flake8
    rev: v3.9.2
    hooks:
      - id: flake8
        additional_dependencies: [flake8-docstrings]
```

#### Updating Pre-Commit Configuration
- Use a `make update` command or a similar script to update the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with the latest configurations.
- Include logic to allow project-specific

 configurations to be included or excluded.

```makefile
# Makefile
update:
    @echo "Updating base template and pre-commit hooks..."
    @curl -o .pre-commit-config.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/djh00t/klingon_tools/repo_templates/python/.pre-commit-config.yaml
    @echo "Applying project-specific configurations..."
    @# Add logic to merge or overwrite configurations here
    @pre-commit autoupdate
```

### Template Usage Instructions

#### `TEMPLATE-USAGE.md`
```markdown
# Template Usage

## Installation
1. Clone the repository from `https://github.com/djh00t/klingon_tools/repo_templates/python/`.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Run pre-commit hooks:
    ```sh
    pre-commit install
    pre-commit run --all-files
    ```
2. Use the `make update` command to keep the base template and pre-commit hooks up to date:
    ```sh
    make update
    ```

## Updating the Template
1. Run the `make update` command to fetch the latest changes:
    ```sh
    make update
    ```
2. Review and merge the generated PR for the updates.

## Customizing the Template
1. To include project-specific configurations in the `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, add your custom hooks to the file.
2. Ensure your custom configurations are not overwritten by the `make update` command by merging them appropriately.
```

This high-level design and additional details ensure that the template repository meets all the requirements, including automated versioning, AI integration, and pre-commit hook management. It also provides clear instructions for installation, usage, and updating, making it easy to start new projects with minimal customization.
