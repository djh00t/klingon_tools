"""Module for various Git operations and utilities.

This module provides functions to interact with a Git repository, including
staging, committing, pushing changes, and running pre-commit hooks. It also
includes functions to retrieve the status of the repository and handle deleted
files.

Typical usage example:

    repo = git_get_toplevel()
    if repo:
        git_commit_file('example.txt', repo)
