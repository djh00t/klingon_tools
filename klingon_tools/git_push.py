"""Module for pushing changes to a remote Git repository.

This module provides functionality to push changes to a remote Git repository
after performing several checks and operations such as validating commit
messages, stashing unstaged changes, rebasing, and applying stashed changes
back.

Typical usage example:

    import git from klingon_tools.git_push import git_push

    repo = git.Repo('/path/to/repo') git_push(repo)
